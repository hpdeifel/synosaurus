** Getting Started

   - Synosaurus is available from [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]]. Install it with:

     : M-x package-install synosaurus

     Or if you really want to install it manually, add the synosaurus directory
     to your load-path:

     : (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/synosaurus")

   - Then enable the minor mode with ~synosaurus-mode~.

** Usage

   The main commands for you to use are:

   - ~synosaurus-lookup~ :: Queries you for a word, looks it up in the
        thesaurus and shows you a list of alternatives. You can click or press
        RET on these alternatives to look them up instead.

   - ~synosaurus-choose-and-replace~ :: Look up the word under the cursor, asks
        you to select one of the alternatives and replaces the original word
        with you selection. You can configure different methods for the
        alternative selection, see below.

   - ~synosaurus-choose-and-insert~ :: Asks for a word, presents a list of
        synonyms to choose from, and inserts the selected one into the current
        buffer.

   The default keybindings are:

   | Key       | Command                       |
   |-----------+-------------------------------|
   | =C-c C-s l= | ~synosaurus-lookup~             |
   | =C-c C-s r= | ~synosaurus-choose-and-replace~ |
   | =C-c C-s i= | ~synosaurus-choose-and-insert~  |

** Configuration

   Synosaurus can be configured through the normal customization interface of
   emacs. Take a look at:

   : M-x customize-group synosaurus

   The individual options are:

   - ~synosaurus-backend~

     The thesaurus backend to use. This can also be set per buffer.

   - ~synosaurus-choose-method~

     The way, ~synosaurus-choose-and-replace~ should query you for
     alternatives. The following symbols are acceptable values.

     - popup :: Use the library popup.el to show a popup with alternatives.
                This is recommended and the default, but you will need to
                install popup.el separately.

     - ido :: Use IDO to show a nice fuzzy matching completing minibuffer.

     - default :: Use the normal minibuffer completion.

** Backends

   Three thesaurus backends are implemented right now in various states of
   completion.

   *Openthesaurus* is a open German thesaurus and is supported quite well, but
   needs an Internet connection to be queried. Its backend function is called
   ~synosaurus-backend-openthesaurus~.

   *Wordnet* is a English thesaurus, that can be installed as a separate program
   called /wn/, that is used offline. Wordnet can do lot's of things other than
   simple lists of synonyms. Not many of these features are supported by
   synosaurus, yet. Wordnet's backend function is called
   ~synosaurus-backend-wordnet~.

   *LEO* is an online dictionary supporting a small number of language pairs
   involving English or German. Only German -> English translations are
   supported at the moment. Its backend function is called
   ~synosaurus-backend-leo~.

** Dependencies

   - popup.el, if you want to use the /popup/ method for choosing alternatives.
